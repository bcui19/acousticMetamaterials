Look up Salome manual 

Input/output (S11 & S21):
	- hit create group and then can go with that 





after meshing
convert to quadratic elements (for better accuracy)
create group form geometry
we know tehre are two ports but need to add them to teh mesh
Reason why we use ENTREE and SORTIE is enforce boundary conditions
doesn't matter which node we grab, variance is small 


create group and click on nodes and click add 


OFFFICIAL
-ignore the warnings
Geometry:
	- cerate whatever geometry you need
	- put entree and sortee as a face (should be a face not a node here)

- from here generate mesh based on your geometry 
	

Mesh:
	- Create groups from geometry to get ENTREE AND SORTEEE
	- Then use create group in mesh to get the node numbers 
		- keep track of the node numbers mapping entree to entree and sortee to sortee 




each experiment you run will need need a comm and export file
-export: specify each of the files 
-comm: specifies which experiment you want to run 

	- few parameters
		low
		high frequency
		delta frequency



- also be careful with the export file:
	- the first entry is a cache so need to be wary that you're not overwriting something that you shouldn't be
