README:

This readme is for general notes and comments about the code base

Critical Notes:
	- code is fairly generalized, but nearly all of the code is based off of the tm/rtm data structure (see below)
	- currently some of the code in getTransmissionWeights assumes that the unit cell is symmetri


Constants:
	- NUM_CYCLES - refers to the number of simulations 



Variables:
	- tm: the transmission matrix class
	- rtm: a data structure which contains information about the transmission matrix


Data structure:
	- rtm (the transmission matrix data structure):
		- Just a list for storing the transmission matrix's information
			- The list's length is NUM_SIMULATIONS * NUM_SIMULATIONS
			- The list is generated by taking each row and appending it to the last row
		- each entry in the list is a dictionary (whose keys are frequencies):
			- the value pair is another dictionary, whose keys are listennnodes (you can just get the first key of dict.keys())
				- the value to the embedded dictionary is teh complex pressure value
